# LMC Solicitors Website

This is a project for a hypotetical legal firm in the heart of the city of London, specialised in family and imigration law.

The firm will be run by two experienced lawyers that have decided to open their own firm in order to help people and their families.

## UX

Following the design in the industry, the webpages were designed to be clean, unclutered and informative. It is not intended to direct sell a product online but  to inform a prospective customer of the services provided by the firm and way of contact.

- As a prospective client, I want to ensure the firm is able to work on my family case prior to contact the office and book an appointment.
